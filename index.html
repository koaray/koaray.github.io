    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Ryan Rayfield, an <span class="highlight">intrapreneur</span>, senior product manager, and 
      technical leader with a passion for building technology solutions that drive 
      operational excellence and user engagement. Throughout my career, I've discovered 
      how to bridge strategic thinking, data analytics, and empathy to create products 
      that genuinely solve problems and transform customer experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      From heading product and technology teams at US Squash to leading implementation 
      for multi-million-dollar SaaS solutions, I’ve consistently merged innovation 
      with practicality—turning complex challenges into scalable systems. I’m fueled 
      by a love of the creative process, from ideation through release.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of product launches and digital transformations, I champion philanthropic 
      and community-driven initiatives, believing technology can—and should—uplift 
      the communities it serves.
