      <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Ryan Rayfield, an <span class="highlight">intrapreneur</span>, senior product manager, and 
        technical leader with a passion for building technology solutions that drive 
        operational excellence and user engagement. Throughout my career, I've learned 
        how to bridge strategic thinking, data analytics, and empathy to create products 
        that genuinely solve problems and transform customer experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        From heading product and technology teams at US Squash to leading implementation 
        for multi-million-dollar SaaS solutions, I’ve consistently merged innovation 
        with practicality—turning complex challenges into scalable systems. I’m fueled 
        by a love of the creative process, from ideation through release.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of product launches and digital transformations, I champion philanthropic 
        and community-driven initiatives, believing technology can—and should—uplift 
        the communities it serves.
